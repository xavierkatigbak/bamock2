            <p>3. Production personnel have to complete a significant amount of paperwork for each "batch" of new 
                    product. Much of the paperwork asks for the exact same information and the worker has to manually 
                    enter it on every form. This is contributing to the plant missing its monthly production goals 
                    unless it offers overtime which eats away profit. Jenny is a BA tackling this issue and suggests 
                    preprinting forms with batch information to avoid having to manually enter it.

                    Congratulations! Jenny's recommendation was accepted. What will she need to ensure happens as a
